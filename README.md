This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### This app is currently functioning

This app will function however, there is currently no Database connected to store the notes created into.  That is not an oversight, I was only building this to get the note taking functionality built.  I will revisit in the near future and add a DB connection to this so that it can store notes and not delete them as soon as you refresh the page.
